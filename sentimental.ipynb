    "Introduction\n",
    "Context\n",
    "Bangalore is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka. With a population of over 15 million, Bangalore is the third largest city in India and 27th largest city in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bangalore has a unique food culture. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bangalore, with various kind of cuisines.With each day new restaurants adding up to the industry and the demand is increasing day by day so it is useful to get some interesting facts and figures about the restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zomato\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of the restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it, however, has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves.\n",

    "What is sentiment analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the computational task of automatically determining what feelings a writer is expressing in text. Sentiment is often framed as a binary distinction (positive vs. negative), but it can also be a more fine-grained, like identifying the specific emotion an author is expressing (like fear, joy or anger).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is used for many applications, especially in business intelligence. Some examples of applications for sentiment analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the social media discussion around a certain topic\n",
    "Evaluating survey responses\n",
    "Determining whether product reviews are positive or negative\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is not perfect, and as with any automatic analysis of language, you will have errors in your results. It also cannot tell you why a writer is feeling a certain way. However, it can be useful to quickly summarize some qualities of text, especially if you have so much text that a human reader cannot analyze all of it.\n",
    "For this project,the goal is to analyzing the Zomato Bangalore dataset is to understand people’s choice of cuisine,dining type,preference for location according to price etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing - Load the dataset, retrieve the reviews (aka documents) and scores, encode the target (scores) and split into a training and test set.\n",
    "Training Model - We will train a simple LSTM model that will predict the rating based solely on the review comments.\n",
    "Evaluation - We will plot the loss and accuracy progression through epochs, and display the classification results as a table."
